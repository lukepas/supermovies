Welcome to the Nests.js Backend Project! 
This project is developed for learning purposes, focusing on building a backend system using Nest.js framework.

### Project Overview üìΩÔ∏è

SuperMovies is a NestJS backend application that provides essential functionalities such as authentication, user/profile management,
CRUD operations for movies and movie categories, as well as an email service.

## Prerequisites üß∞

Before running the app, you need to have the following installed on your machine:

* Node.js v16 or later
* npm v6 or later

### Features üîÆ
Authentication
The authentication module provides endpoints for user registration, login, and logout. It uses JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure authentication.

## User/Profile Management
Users can manage their profiles, including updating their information and deleting their accounts. Profile information may include user details like name, email, and any additional data.

## Movie CRUD Operations
This module allows CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for movies. Users can add new movies, view existing movies, update movie details, and delete movies from the system.

## Movie Category CRUD Operations
Similar to movie management, this module handles CRUD operations for movie categories. Users can create, read, update, and delete categories for better organization of movies.

## Email Service
The email service sends notifications or transactional emails to users for various events, such as account creation, password reset, or any other customized notifications.
